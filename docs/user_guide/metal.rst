Apple GPUs (Metal)
==================

.. currentmodule:: warp

Warp can run kernels on Apple Silicon GPUs through a Metal backend. On a Mac with a Metal-enabled build,
the GPU appears as the device ``"metal:0"`` and is the default device:

.. code-block:: python

    import warp as wp


    @wp.kernel
    def scale(a: wp.array[float], s: float):
        i = wp.tid()
        a[i] = a[i] * s


    a = wp.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=float, device="metal:0")
    wp.launch(scale, dim=3, inputs=[a, 2.0], device="metal:0")
    print(a.numpy())  # [2. 4. 6.]

:func:`wp.is_metal_available() <warp.is_metal_available>` reports whether a Metal device was found, and
``Device.is_metal`` identifies one. Code that selects a device with ``wp.get_device()``
or ``wp.ScopedDevice`` needs no changes. Code that tests ``device.is_cuda`` to decide whether it runs on a GPU
should test ``not device.is_cpu`` instead.

Requirements
------------

* Apple Silicon and macOS 15 or newer.
* A build of Warp that contains the Metal runtime. The macOS wheels on PyPI do not. Build from source with
  ``build_lib.py`` or CMake (see :ref:`building-from-source`); both compile ``warp/native/metal.mm`` on macOS.
  Xcode is not needed at run time: kernels are compiled from source by the Metal framework when a module loads,
  and the result is kept in the kernel cache.

Supported Features
------------------

Kernels and user functions, structs, tile operations, backward kernels and :class:`wp.Tape <Tape>`,
graph capture and replay including :func:`wp.capture_if() <capture_if>` and :func:`wp.capture_while() <capture_while>`,
meshes, BVHs, hash grids, NanoVDB volumes, textures, atomic operations, ``wp.ref`` parameters,
``print()`` and assertions inside kernels, and DLPack, NumPy and PyTorch interoperability.

Memory Model
------------

Apple GPUs share memory with the CPU. Arrays on a Metal device live in unified memory, so their ``ptr`` is a valid
host pointer:

* ``array.numpy()`` and ``__array_interface__`` return a view, not a copy. Warp synchronizes the device before
  handing out the pointer.
* :func:`wp.to_torch() <warp.to_torch>` returns a zero-copy PyTorch **CPU** tensor, with ``grad`` attached when the
  array has one. PyTorch's ``mps`` tensors cannot alias Warp arrays: PyTorch does not expose their buffers, and it
  schedules work on its own command queue. Move data to ``mps`` explicitly when a network should run on the GPU.
* NumPy arrays and PyTorch CPU tensors can be passed to a Metal kernel directly. Warp maps their pages into the
  GPU address space without copying and synchronizes after such a launch. The mapping is released when the object
  is garbage collected; for objects that cannot be weakly referenced it stays until the process exits. Mapping is
  page granular, so the GPU can address the whole pages around the data, and overlapping mappings are merged.
  The memory must stay mapped in the process for as long as the object lives: memory from a custom allocator
  that is unmapped while the object is still alive leaves the GPU with a dangling mapping.
* Copies between ``"cpu"`` and ``"metal:0"`` are plain memory copies.

Limitations
-----------

* **No** ``float64``. Apple GPUs have no double-precision type. A kernel that uses ``wp.float64``, or a vector,
  matrix or struct built on it, raises when it is launched on Metal. The rest of its module still loads.
* Apple's GPU compiler can miscompile kernels in which several fully unrolled products of 4x4 or larger matrices
  are inlined together: values computed later in the kernel come out as zero. Warp's own matrix product avoids
  this on Metal, which fixed zero gradients of ``wp.mat44`` products and inverses. Kernels with hand-written,
  fully unrolled loop nests of that size can meet the same condition, so check their results and gradients
  against the CPU device.
* Cooperative tile operations need full thread blocks, as on CUDA: launch tile kernels with
  :func:`wp.launch_tiled() <launch_tiled>`. A plain ``wp.launch()`` whose size is not a multiple of
  ``block_dim`` leaves the last block partial; operations on shared tiles in that block return undefined
  values (full blocks are unaffected, and nothing hangs).
* **Tile kernels are forward only.** Kernels that use tile operations have no adjoint on Metal.
* If the adjoint of a module fails to compile on Metal, Warp warns and rebuilds the module forward-only, so the
  forward pass keeps working. Launching one of its backward kernels raises.
* A launch can have at most 2\ :sup:`32` - 1 threads, because Metal indexes threads with 32 bits (for tile
  kernels, counting the threads that pad the last block). A larger launch raises.
* Tile kernels are limited by threadgroup memory, 32 KB on current Apple GPUs. A kernel whose tiles need more
  raises at launch. Keeping block-local tiles small, or accumulating into an output tile
  (``wp.tile_matmul(a, b, out)``) instead of creating temporaries, stays below the limit.
* Not every atomic operation is atomic on Metal, which only has 32-bit atomics and, from the Apple9 GPU family
  (M3, A17) on, unsigned 64-bit minimum and maximum. All operations on 32-bit integers and floats are atomic, and
  so is ``wp.atomic_add()`` on 16-bit types, including ``wp.float16`` and ``wp.bfloat16``. The rest is as follows:

  * ``wp.atomic_add()`` on 64-bit integers adds the two halves separately. The final value is exact, but a kernel
    that reads the element while others add to it can see a half-updated value.
  * ``wp.atomic_min()`` and ``wp.atomic_max()`` on ``wp.uint64`` are atomic on Apple9 and later, where the returned
    previous value can be stale under contention. On older GPUs they are plain read-modify-write.
  * Plain read-modify-write, correct only without concurrent writers to the same element: every atomic operation
    on 8-bit integers; minimum, maximum, exchange, compare-and-swap and the bitwise operations (``&=``, ``|=``,
    ``^=``) on 16-bit types; minimum and maximum on ``wp.int64``; exchange, compare-and-swap and the bitwise
    operations on 64-bit integers.
* Spinlocks built from ``wp.atomic_cas()`` can hang: Apple GPUs do not guarantee forward progress between
  SIMD lanes.
* ``wp.fixedarray``, fabric arrays, deterministic mode (``wp.config.deterministic``) and saveable (APIC) captures
  are not supported.
* Host-side utilities that are not recorded into a graph, such as building or changing the topology of a
  :class:`warp.sparse.BsrMatrix`, raise when called during a graph capture on Metal. Call them outside the
  capture.
* Native snippets (:func:`wp.func_native() <func_native>`) must be valid Metal Shading Language. Pointer casts need
  an address space, for which Warp defines ``WP_THREAD`` and ``WP_DEVICE`` (both empty on CPU and CUDA), and
  ``long long`` is not available.
* Transcendental functions can differ from their CPU results in the last bit.

Performance Notes
-----------------

* Launches are recorded into a command buffer and run asynchronously. Reading an array on the host synchronizes.
* Graph capture removes most of the per-launch cost and is worth using for many small kernels.
* ``wp.capture_while()`` evaluates its condition on the host between iterations on Metal. A fixed iteration count
  is usually faster for short loops.
* Tile kernels run one tile per threadgroup. Their throughput is bounded by threadgroup memory, so they scale less
  well with problem size than they do on CUDA.
